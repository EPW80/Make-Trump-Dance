# Scene Project

This project is a simple Pygame-based game that demonstrates how to create and manage scenes using the Pygame library. The game consists of a main menu scene with a title and instructions on how to proceed. The background music is also included in the project, which plays when the scene is started.

## Prerequisites

To run the game, you need to have Python 3.8 or higher installed on your system. Additionally, you'll need the Pygame library, which can be installed using the following command:

```
bash
Copy code
Create Virtual Environment(pyhton3 -m venv env)
pip install pygame
Running the Game
To run the game, navigate to the videogame folder and run the game.py script:

bash
Copy code
cd videogame
python game.py
This will start the game, and you should see the main menu scene with the title and instructions on how to proceed. Press any key to exit the game.
```

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following files and folders:

game.py: The main script to run the game. This file initializes the Pygame library, sets up the game window, and manages the game loop.
scene.py: This file contains the Scene classes used to create and manage different scenes in the game.
rgbcolors.py: A file containing RGB color definitions to be used throughout the project.
videogame/data: A folder containing the background music file for the main menu scene.
